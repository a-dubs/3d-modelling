# 3D Modelling Sandbox / Showcase

A collection of various 3D models I created over time and want to show to world


<br>

## Summary
 - These are all creations that I either made out of boredom or for some personal project that just was not important enough to have its own spot on my GitHub - so they live here now 
 - Models that can be found in this collection include:
   - Skar VXF12 Subwoofer
   - Plan for dorm room layout
   - 2 dream monitor layout concepts
